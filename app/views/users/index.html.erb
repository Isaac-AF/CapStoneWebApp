    </ul>

    <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
    <p>This web app was developed as part of the <em>Application Development</em> course at the University of Chicago, with the goal of enhancing existing nutrition trackers using the latest AI tools. Anyone who has ever tried to follow a diet or count calories knows how tedious and difficult the process can be, especially when what we eat every day can be quite dynamic. I had personally tried apps like MyFitnessPal and Foodvisor, but found that I was constantly having to make manual updates and try to shove my meals into static lists of foods that didn't match what I had cooked or ordered at a restaurant. Or, dinner time would roll around, and I would be presented with an infinite number of choices of what to cook or order, and didn't know how to make that decision to meet my goals. I was also struggling to build workouts due to not having the knowledge required to pair the right muscle groups together, and saw an opportunity to optimize my workouts and track smarter, not harder. </p>

    <p>Start making smarter choices with less friction. SmartMacros is here to support your wellness journey, one bite at a time.</p>
